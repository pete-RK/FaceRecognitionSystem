#### SER594 : Revised Project Proposal

#### Title : Face Recognition System for Identifying required Subjects (Celebrities)

#### Author :  Pete Rohan Kanparthi

#### Date : 10/30/2023

#### Keywords

Image Processing, Face Recognition System, Wavelet TransForms

#### Description

The project's objective is to analyze various pictures of a test subject(a celebrity) and develop a model that can then help us identify the desired subject among others. This classification model utilizes the latest mathematical functions in deriving various factors or features that influence how a computer system can identify an area of interest(human face) among other areas inside the picture. The project can help in identifying individuals by extracting facial features.

#### Research Objectives

RO1(Exploratory visualization work): To identify and highlight a person (test subject) among others in a picture containing multiple people.

RO2(Machine Learning Technique - Classification): To predict, using a classification model, the presence of a person (test subject) among others in a picture with multiple people and highlight them.

RO3(Defensibility): To defend the efficiency of the predictive model, this objective will employ rigorous testing and validation activities, ensuring the model's accuracy in identifying a person (test subject) among others.

RO4(Causal Analysis): To describe the relations between the underlying causal factors for face recognition systems, this project will conduct an analysis on the factors using mathematical models to understand their influence in identifying human faces in images.

#### Intellectual Merit

The intellectual merit of this project is in understanding the various features that can be drawn using mathematical models from a picture of a human face (celebrity) that enable a computer system to identify these features in a multitude of other pictures and select the ones that consist of the required test subject. This model can then be used in identifying faces of people among other faces in a more efficient and faster manner. Additionally, by analyzing the causal relationships between those features, we can have a better understanding of how each feature can be utilized in creating a highly efficient working model.

#### Data Sourcing

For data downloading we can use google as a source for images as the test subject is a celebrity. The images can be downloaded in bulk by using web browser extensions like Fatkun, Image Downloader, etc. Other means employ the use of web scraping technique, but this technique is not recommended.
