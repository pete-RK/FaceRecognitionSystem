# Multi-Modal Face Recognition System
Overview

Welcome to the Multi-Modal Face Recognition System repository! This project is designed to provide a robust and efficient face recognition solution using Python, OpenCV, PyWavelets, and Haarcascades. The system incorporates multi-modal biometric fusion for enhanced accuracy, making it suitable for various applications such as security systems, access control, and user authentication.
Key Features

    Face Detection using Haarcascades: Real-time face detection leveraging the power of Haarcascades for accurate identification.

    Multi-Modal Biometric Fusion: Integration of PyWavelets for combining information from different facial features to improve recognition accuracy.

    Wavelet Transform for Feature Extraction: Efficient extraction of relevant facial features using the wavelet transform from PyWavelets.

    Dynamic Database Management: A dynamic face database that can be updated in real-time to adapt to changing recognition requirements.

    User-friendly Interface: Intuitive interface for system configuration, face enrollment, and recognition feedback, with customization options.

    Real-time Feedback and Logging: Real-time feedback on face recognition results, including match confidence levels. Logging of recognition events for auditing and analysis.

    Security Measures: Implementation of security measures, including anti-spoofing mechanisms, to prevent unauthorized access.

    Compatibility and Integration: Easily integrate into existing Python projects or systems, compatible with various hardware configurations.
