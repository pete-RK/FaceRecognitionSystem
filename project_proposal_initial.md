Description: This project analyzes various pictures of a test subject(a celebrity) and develops a model whihc can then help us identify the desired subject amoung others.

Intellectual Merit: This project helps in identifying people when the resolution of the picture is low and is hard for the human eye to identify them. 
It also helps us identify the test subject amoung other people in a faster way.

Data Sourcing: For data downloading we can use google as a source for images as the test subject is a celebrity. 
The images can be downloaded in bulk by using web browser extensions like Fatkun, Image Downloader, etc.

Background Knowledge: 
1) Face Recognition System: https://towardsdatascience.com/face-recognition-for-beginners-a7a9bd5eb5c2
2) Image Processing: https://neptune.ai/blog/image-processing-python
3) Hard Cascades(OpenCV): https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/db/d28/tutorial_cascade_classifier.html

All the above mentioned liks can help us get a better understanding about the current project
